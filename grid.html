            <div>In Cascading Style Sheets, CSS grid layout or CSS grid creates complex responsive web design layouts more 
                easily and consistently across browsers. There have been other methods for controlling web page layout 
                methods, such as tables, the box model, and CSS flex box. CSS grid is currently not an official standard 
                (it is a W3C Candidate Recommendation) although it has been adopted by most major browsers.</div>
