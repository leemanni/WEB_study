    <h2>Java Script 란 무엇인가..?</h2>
    <p>
    <strong>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/)</strong>, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language
    that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled,
     and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

    <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
       This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
       presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
       .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached
       to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
